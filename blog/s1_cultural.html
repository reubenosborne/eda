            <h2>Personal Values</h2>

            <p>After a full day of command line and version control you would think an exploration into my personal
                values would be both easy, and enjoyable. But for some reason it had me stumped. Sometimes the things we
                hold closest are the hardest to see, yet as I dug deeper a lot came spilling out.</p>

            <p>It became increasingly apparent as I spoke to others and reflected on my life’s path that something I
                hold extremely close is my relationships; friends, family, lovers and community. But also the person I
                am yet to meet.</p>

            <p>As I was brought up by my single mother, travelling from country to country but largely being based in
                Bali, I was exposed to a lot of different cultures and different people. It’s not far fetched to see how
                this would have been catalytic for my tolerance and generosity towards others as well as my appreciation
                for diversity and uniqueness. Everyone has value and everyone deserves respect.</p>

            <p>Once we had settled I was exposed to a new way of living with people. Mum married a dairy farmer with a
                large Irish Catholic family and I found myself immersed in new familial dynamics. My grandma and uncle
                living just down the path, my cousins up the road. It wasn’t uncommon for family dinner to be 10 people
                and Christmas involved more people than students at my school. Such varied exposure to people helped me
                understand the nuances of relationships and has led me to valuing ‘Family’ with high regard.</p>

            <p>I also value my time, my autonomy, my freedom. I have an unconventional and varied path to where I am
                now, with lots of indulgences in my own journey and time spent understanding myself. Travel and in
                particular what motivated me to travel reflects these values; often spending large chunks of time in new
                environments purely to better understand myself.</p>

            <p>I value beauty. Evident in my love of creating spaces for people to be in, the right music, lighting,
                food and wine. I run small events focused on sharing music and poetry; environments for people to
                connect with each other. I lean towards potlucks and board games but also art festivals where people can
                express themselves through performance, sculpture and adornment.</p>

            <h2>Strengths & Limitations</h2>

            <p>My focus on people and community lends itself to my learning through approaching it as a shared activity.
                One where we can draw from each other to propel each other forward. I love EDA’s approach to learning,
                encouraging our advancement through interacting with our cohort. Teaching a concept is the ultimate test
                of understanding it and I see how moving together as a group will crystallize our knowledge.</p>

            <p>I am prone to sacrificing my own personal wellbeing and aspirations through seeing myself as a part of a
                larger body of people and losing sight of myself as an individual. I can also get caught up in how I
                stand in comparison to others rather than applying focus to my own personal goals, achievements, and
                limitations.</p>

            <p>I believe it’s easy to overcompensate as we strive for something, especially if that thing is an aspect
                of ourselves we are developing. I have also noticed in myself a stark contrast to a community-mindset, a
                self-absorption that I hope to understand and mature.</p>

            <p>My last living environment involved eight people in a big house exploring ways in which we could live
                together. We had communal ethics and a loose idea of what we wanted to achieve by living together but
                this did not stop tensions arising. I learnt a lot. Ultimately we were able to explore different ways of
                mediating any tensions that arose through conversation, decision making process and shared agreement.
                Observing myself in this environment was particularly interesting and I frequently found myself coming
                up against what I felt was a culture of individualism in a communal flat. I explored speaking to people
                one on one, group meetings, consensus based decision (difficult, we didn’t have a vacuum cleaner for two
                months as a result), majority vote and more. It felt quite political at times. In approaching this
                situation again I would ask the group to develop a constitution together, dial in what our core values
                are, and fall back on them when we were up against a difficult decision.</p>
