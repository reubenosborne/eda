                What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?

            <h2>Learnings</h2>

            <p>
                I went into the 'Core' learning with confidence. Skimming over the content never produced something that
                I had not encountered before, or had not considered. I also knew about the material, considering it one
                of the aspects of Dev Academy that led me to study here.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've reflected on this confidence as it could be a part of my ego that prevents me from pursuing greater
                depth in these skills or abilities. Thinking "Oh, I can do that" is a fixed mindset on something that
                has no end.
            </p>

            <p>

            </p>

            <!-- <h2>Surprises</h2>

            <p>
                I've had few surprises.
            </p> -->

            <h2>Challenges</h2>

            <p>
                Though the challenges were few, diging into my values and my identity had it's difficulties. I realised
                that it had been some time since I had stopped to consider my values and that I wasn't easily drawing to
                mind what they may be. Knowing what you value seems like a neccessary compass to guide you through life
                though I'm sure they guide whether you know them or not, being able to remind oneself of what you value
                seems like a useful tool to keep on track.
            </p>

            <p>
                Exploring my values was far more valuable than I had expected, especially as I looked into my past to
                see where these may have been formed. Questioning what my values are, and why, allows me to strenghten
                my objectives in life and let go of things that are not serving me.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Core?</h2>

            <p>
                The focus on core skills within this curriculum makes perfect sense. Though developing can be a very
                isolated task, and primary relationships often form between human and computer, there is a lot of need
                for interpersonal skills and self awareness. Writing code is only one aspect of working in this industry
                and knowing how to be an effective part of a team not only saves time and money, it can lend itself to
                better products overall.
            </p>

            <p>
                A well integrated team has developers being able to shape products with their insight. Being able to
                effectively communicate what you are observing in your work but also conveying this to other people in
                the team can improve projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                I see this industry pushing back on one's mental and physical health with it's stresses (broken code,
                deadlines, potential for loss). Being aware of your headspace and taking the neccessary precautions for
                your health is essential. I've already witnessed how the body and mind feels after a day of getting lost
                in code without taking breaks.
            </p>

            <h2>Is it worth it?</h2>

            <p>
                Without a doubt. I see immense value to building a toolkit that is more than just technical ability.
                Self awareness and the ability to keep focused and clear benefits everyone.
            </p>

            <p>
                A team needs to know how to look after theirselves as well as the team as a whole to thrive. Core skills
                enable this.
