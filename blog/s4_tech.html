            <h2>You shall not pass..</h2>


            <p>
                It's all going swimmingly. You've read over the problem, broken it into it's smallest logical parts, rewritten it into 'pseudocode' a series of notes detailing what you want to achieve with each line of code. Writing the code is a breeze.
            </p>
            <p>
                "For every person in this list of people.." you think to yourself. "Well that's a For Loop" you proclaim.
            </p>
            <p>
                And.. nope.
            </p>
            <p>
                Try as you might it just doesn't seem to work. So you approach the console, a sort of <i>magical sandbox</i> to test ideas. You give it an object, it gives you what that object hides inside. You test out methods and it shows you what that method provides.
            </p>
            <p>
                The console has shown you that everything you want to do is possible. So you go back to your code and try again. This time you read it out line by line. "If the remainder of.."
            </p>
            <p>
                Your flatmate asks you if you're okay.
            </p>
            <p>
                Are you okay? You think you're okay. You're a little confused and start to think that maybe, though the problem looks simple, you're just not at this level yet. But surely..
            </p>
            <p>
                What does the error say?
            </p>
            <p>
                The testing error doesn't show much. It kind of just tells you wat you already know, that it's not working.
            </p>
            <p>
                You send your block of code to a developer friend. "Help". They send back a laughing emoji. Just then, as you've committed to burdening a friend with a simple problem you realise that '1' is meant to be a '0'.
            </p>
            <p>
                You announce this to your friend. They confirm and explain what the code would have been trying to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                And it's on to the next.. next time you won't just go through line by line, you'll go through character by character.

            <h2>Open Sesame</h2>


            <p>
                I encountered the above situation a number of times whilst working through Sprint Four's coding Katas. Making small mistakes. Using the console to understand what I was trying to do with my code. I did call on my friend once and it was amazing at how quickly I saw the error when I posted it to him via messenger.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I also had successes. Once I was so engaged with a problem but had to leave my computer to go say goodbye to a friend that I spent the 40 minute bus ride with a notebook and pen scribbling down solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a particularly interesting way of going about things because there's no confirmation or otherwise that what I'm doing is correct. And yet, I seemed to be able to see where my 'answers' would fail, and where they were to succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Holding everything in this theoretical space was rewarding as it showed my capability to understand. Going home and testing the code to find it worked, immensely.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another proud moment was when I was able to collapse two entire functions into one by simply passing an extra argument into the first. Nothing better than deleting lines of now redundant code.
            </p>
            

            <h2>Feelings ‚ô°</h2>


            <p>
                There's ups and downs in code. Sometimes you're breezing through, tapping into the dopamine of solving problems, and sometimes you're in the corner grunting with frustration because "you've tried every thing you can".
            </p>

            <p>
                It's important to remember you're on a rollercoaster and that there's always something more challenging ahead, but there's also successes that will make it all worth it.
