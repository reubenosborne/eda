            <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

            <p>
                Though I’m familiar with the concept of neuroplasticity, this was my first encounter of  the concept of having a ‘Growth Mindset’ and I’m grateful for it. It casts my learning and development into a whole newlight, one where I feel I understand my positive development a lot more, but I’m also exposed to likely reasons why I haven’t succeeded in other areas. The language used in regards to my intelligence has given me a disadvantageous approach to my education and a model ‘fixed mindset’.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’ve watched several resources on both neuroplasticity and growth mindset, though I haven’t uncovered anything incredibly engaging, it has been good to reinforce these ideas – especially as I undertake some challenging study.
            </p>

            <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>

            <p>
                My understanding of neuroplasticity can be summed up with the commonly touted line ‘Neurons that fire together, wire together’. Most of my previous knowledge has been inferred from this. Still, it’s not something that I find is particularly present as I approach learned skills or habits. I’ve come out of this research with far more intention to keep it present as, just as I can learn new things in a positive way (skills, positive habits), It also gives weight to how my unhelpful habits will only continue to be reinforced if I don’t consciously practice otherwise.
            </p>

            <p>
                Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity breaks people out of the fixed mentality that the way we are now, is the way that we will always be. Everyone has aspirations to move away from their poor habits and grow new ones, as well as learning new skills. Knowing that this is possible encourages people to persevere as the fruits of labour are backed. Simply having the belief that one is able to achieve something is most of the way to doing so.
            </p>

            <p>
                The benefit of engaging with the principles of neuroplasticity while studying is apparent. The immediately apparent way I can do so is to reinforce my neural networks, and strengthen my ability, through practise. Revision and repetition can be reinforced by timing, intensity, and salience.
            </p>

            <p>
                Increasing neuroplasticity is an interesting rabbithole to go down. A lot of the resources I came across suggested that neuroplasticity can be increased through maintaining physical wellness through sleep, diet, exercise. A lot of people suggested quite particular supplementation, from herbs to nootropics. Continuous learning, whether through picking up a new language or instrument, finding yourself in a new environment, reading a new book, playing a new game, doing something familiar in an unfamiliar way, all contributes
                to a greater plasticity. There was even mention of psilocybin.
            </p>

            <p>
                A resource that I’ve found particularly interesting is from a <a
                    href="https://www.neuroskills.com/brain-injury/ten-principles-of-neuroplasticity.php">Traumatic
                    Brain Injury Resource Guide</a>
                detailing ten principles of Neuroplasticity. Looking at neuroplasticity from a health context rather than an educational one gives a different, but reinforcing, perspective.
