            <h3>What do I want?</h3>
            <p>I'm entering a career in Web Development in pursuit of a lifestyle that I find both challenging yet
                rewarding. I'm seeking like minded people who want to build things to make life a little easier or more
                enjoyeable for all.</p>
            <p>I'm drawn in by the idea of being part of a dynamic industry that's forward thinking. I also find the
                oppurtunites and the flexibility very appealing.</p>
            <p>I don't see myself ultimately being a developer, instead I want to build a foundation of knowledge and
                experience in development before utilising it in a broader role. Aspects of software development that
                I'm interested in are facilitating understanding and communication between developers and clients/end
                users; research and business analysis; user mapping; design and user experience; team management and
                project management.</p>
            <p>After querying people in the industry about these particular interests and what sort of role incorporates
                them a few people have mentioned 'Project Management', which is now my long term goal.</p>
            <h3>What do I need to get there?</h3>
            <p>The skills I hope to develop in this course, outside of the technical skills I will acquire, are as
                follows:</p>
            <p><em>Confidence</em>, I find though I know I have a lot to offer this industry, I am constantly hindered
                by my self-belief and it's effect on my pursuits.</p>
            <p><em>Calm,</em> This undertaking is intensive and there will be moments of stress. I often find myself
                future-tripping and sending myself into uneccessary state of worry. I would like to develop a sense of
                calm and presence that I can use when pressures rise.</p>
            <p><em>Time Management, Self Discipline, Focus,</em> The fact that I might be faced with the oppurtunity to
                be developing remotely whilst living in various environments that suit me (the bush, the beach, Berlin)
                motivates me to focus on and acquire the necessary skills to do so. I have not proven to myself in the
                past I am capable of such a thing but see EDA as a perfect oppurtunity to change that story.</p>
            <p><em>Leadership & Diplomacy,</em> EDA is also a perfect oppurtunity to see how I operate in a team but
                also how I might lead a team or project. I would like to put particular efforts into this to deepen my
                understanding of how I work in such a role.</p>
            <p><em>Communication & Listening,</em> I have put considerable efforts to these soft skills but there is
                always the oppurtunity to improve more.</p>
            <h3>My Commitment</h3>
            <p>Whilst I engage in my coursework and my community involvement, both internally and externally, I will
                keep my values close to heart and keep my focus on what my desired outcomes are.</p>
            <p>Means of doing so could include a thought out Mantra to repeat to myself to reinforce the above in a
                succint manner. I will benefit from revisiting and refining what it is I am pursuing.</p>
            <p>If I find myself straying from this path, or if my path is detrimental to my mental and/or physical
                health, then I will call on my support channels in the form of family, friends, my facilitator, faculty,
                and any external mentors I may acquire; depending on the severity.</p>
            <p>I also make a commitment to my community and my cohort. That I will try do my best by them, engage with
                people to strengthen both personal and technical relationships, and facilitate learning where I can.</p>
            <h3>My Expectations</h3>
            <p>I expect EDA and the faculty that I will be working with to support me through my learning journey, and
                with my learning plan, by:</p>
            <p><em>Holding me accountable and giving me feedback if they observe me not keeping to my personal
                    goals.</em></p>
            <p><em>Supporting me in my career by giving me advice, sharing their observations of my skills and
                    limitations, and connecting me with oppurtunities that arise they see me being able to take
                    advantage of.</em></p>
            <p><em>Also, please help me find work!</em></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Scheduling Commitments</h3>
            <p>I will be in Melbourne from the 10th of May to the 14th of May. I will be able to be contacted and
                available to complete work but will have slightly limited resources.</p>
