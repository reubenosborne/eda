            <h2>
                HTML & CSS
            </h2> 
            <p>Hyper Text Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheets, not immediately decipherable from the get go but relatively simple to understand.</p>
            <p>Here's how I described the difference to a friend the other day:</p>
            <p>Imagine you make a chair. You start with a block of something to sit on. You give it four legs. You want a backrest as it's not a stool. HTML creates these elements of an object (website) with none of the details. It's the raw shape or form of something.</p>
            <p>CSS then comes along and transforms the chair (website). It gives the chair size, material, thickness, colour. </p>
            <p><b>Bonus:</b>  Javascript gives the chair it's functionality. Does the chair fold closed? Does it stack? Can it be moved?</p>
            <h2>
                Control flow
            </h2>
            <p>What is control flow?</p>
            <p>Control flow is quite simply the order in which code is read, generally, from top to bottom in sequence.</p>
            <p>Loops are when code will repeat a certain section of code until a certain criteria is met.</p>
            <p>It's comparable to following a recipe, or baking a cake. You follow the instructions step by step but instead of a recipe saying:</p>
            <ul>
                <ol>Sift Flour</ol>
                <ol>Crack egg into bowl</ol>
                <ol>Crack egg into bowl</ol>
                <ol>Crack egg into bowl</ol>
                <ol>Crack egg into bowl</ol>
                <ol>Melt butter</ol>
            </ul>
            <p>A loop would denote multiple steps differently:</p>
            <ul>
                <ol>Sift Flour</ol>
                <ol>For each egg you're using, crack it into bowl</ol>
                <ol>Melt Butter</ol>
            </ul>
            <p>Loops ultimately save time, have less room for error, are more accepting of change and convey information cleanly and concisely.</p>
            <h2>
                The DOM
            </h2>
            <p>The DOM, or 'Document Object Model' is a singular object that is created as a sort of <i>map</i> of a website's elements. The DOM assists in Javascript's ability to manipulate HTML & CSS on a website.</p>
            <p>The ways you can interact with the DOM are virtually endless. Elements of a website that are visible and presented on the screen can be manipulated, hidden or shown. Their attributes can be altered, giving them different visual characteristics - perhaps to alert an user of something particular like a warning.</p>
            <h2>Arrays & Objects</h2>
            <p>Arrays and objects have similarities (Arrays are objects!!) but the situations in which we would use them and the ways in which we interact with them are different.</p>
            <p>Arrays are akin to lists. You can store all sorts of things within an array. This 'list' has an 'index', a means of accessing each individual entry. Entries can be removed, altered, added with various commands.</p>
            <p>Objects can also store pieces of data but in the form of a 'key/value' pairing. The <i>key</i> esentially being a name or description of the <i>value</i>.</p>
            <h2>
                Functions
            </h2>
            <p>Functions are here to make our lives far simpler. They're <i>executable</i> snippets of code that.. do things. Things that we tell them to do.</p>
            <p>Functions are essentially commands. If a function relies on information it does not start with then we can give the hungry l'il function 'arguments'. </p>
            <p>They're able to be reused so they speed up our ability write an application/website. This also makes our code cleaner.</p>
